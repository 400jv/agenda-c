## 🧾 About
It is just a program to register someone's contacts. Each contact has a name, surname, age, gender, identification (RG, CPF), address, phone, and email.

The contacts are registered on a file called "cadastros.txt" If the file no already created the program creates when just started, but, if the file exists the program will read all the contacts and put on an array of contacts.

## 📁 File "cadastro.txt"
Some word has accents and on my current terminal there is some conflict with it, then it shows these stranger caracteres.
